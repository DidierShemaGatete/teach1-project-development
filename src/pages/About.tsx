                <p className="mb-4">
                  TEACH1 was founded by a certified home care professional with a passion for educating families. After years of working in direct patient care, we saw a gap â€” families wanted to help, but didn't always know how.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  We witnessed the transformation that occurred when family members were properly trained in caregiving techniques. Not only did the quality of care improve, but the emotional wellbeing of both the caregiver and care recipient flourished.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TEACH1 bridges that gap with hands-on education, consultancy, and personalized support. Our approach empowers families to provide excellent care while maintaining the invaluable family connection.
